			' Jungle Camp is a serene camping site near Ooty set up against the backdrop of glistening waterfalls and dense forests. The area is known for its coffee, tea, spices and rosemary cultivation, and the vast expanse of lush green fields en route is a treat to the eyes. The region is also home to some exotic wildlife, and if you are in luck, you may be able to spot some elephants, tigers or bears during your outing. Do try your hand at rock climbing and fishing at the camping site. The camp also organizes treks, campfires and jeep safaris for guests.'

You can trek into the forests, go mountain biking, spend a quiet morning bird watching, or indulge in sports like paragliding. Wind up the day with some rum by the campfire, and spend the night on a machaan or in your cozy tent.'
